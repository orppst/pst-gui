 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Don't use the available yarn scripts, this React app is being run by the Quinoa extension to Quarkus.

Simply start Quarkus in dev mode from the parent directory

`quarkus dev`

Then navigate to your quarkus webserver endpoint, usually `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:8080`
and begin coding.  React pages are proxied to the same endpoint as Quarkus, and code changes are available live.

## Learn More
